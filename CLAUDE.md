# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

This project uses **Bun** (not npm/node) as the package manager and runtime.

```bash
bun install                 # install dependencies
bun run dev                 # run dev server with watch mode (src/index.ts)
bun test                    # run all tests
bun test --watch            # run tests in watch mode
bun test path/to/file.test.ts   # run a single test file
bun run lint                # eslint check
bun run lint:fix            # eslint with autofix
bun run type-check          # tsc --noEmit
bun run build               # bundle to dist/index.js (bun build, targets node)
bun run start               # run the built dist/index.js
```

Tests are colocated in `__tests__` (or `__test__`) directories next to the code they cover, using `bun:test` (not Jest/Vitest) with `mock`/`mock.module` for mocking. Env vars required by `src/env.ts` must be present for tests to run — see `.github/workflows/test.yml` for the full list of vars and their dummy CI values.

Environment files are loaded based on `NODE_ENV` (`development` → `.env.development`, `test` → `.env.test`, `production` → `.env.production`), all parsed/validated through the zod schema in `src/env.ts`. Nothing should read `process.env` directly outside of that file.

## Architecture

Express 5 app (`src/server.ts`) exported as default and started conditionally in `src/index.ts` (only calls `app.listen` outside of `production`, since production runs behind Vercel's serverless rewrite defined in `vercel.json`).

### Route layout

Each route group is its own directory under `src/` with an `index.ts` that builds an Express `Router` and wires one file per handler (one handler per file is the convention — see `src/pricelist-routes`, `src/products-routes`, `src/analysis-routes`, `src/user-routes`, `src/service-routes`, `src/llm-routes`, `src/clerk-routes`). Route-specific helpers live in a `helpers/` subfolder next to the handlers that use them.

Mounting order and auth layering happens in `src/server.ts`:
- `/health` — no auth.
- `/api/*` — double-gated: `clerkMiddleware()` (Clerk session) then `authPublicMiddleware` (requires `X-Internal-API-Secret` header matching `API_SECRET_KEY`). Mounted under this: `pricelist`, `products`, `analysis`, `llm`, `user`.
- `/clerk/*` — Clerk webhooks (signature-verified via `svix`, not the two middlewares above). Note `/clerk/create-user` needs `express.raw()` body parsing (mounted *before* the global `express.json()` — order matters) so the webhook signature can be verified against the raw body.
- `/service/*` — internal/background-job routes, gated by `authServiceMiddleware` (`Authorization: Bearer <API_SERVICE_KEY>`), used for cross-service writes (inserting price lists, analysis data/diffs, notification fan-out, cache invalidation) rather than public reads.
- `ensureDbConnectionMiddleware` runs globally before routes and lazily opens the Mongoose connection (`src/db/database.ts`), caching the connection on `global.mongoose` so repeated invocations (e.g. serverless cold starts) reuse it.
- A final Express error-handling middleware returns `{ error: "Internal Server Error" }`, and additionally `details` when `isDev()`. Route handlers should catch and call `next(error)` rather than handling errors themselves.

Full endpoint-by-endpoint request/response contracts are documented in `API.md` (in Russian) — check it before changing route behavior, and update it when adding/changing endpoints.

### Data layer

Mongoose models live in `src/db/models/*`, each backed by a schema in `src/db/schemas/*` (kept as separate files so schemas can be composed/reused, e.g. `pricelist.ts` schema embeds the `goods` schema). Corresponding hand-written TS types for API payloads live in `src/types/*` and are imported with `import type`.

### Cache

`src/cache/index.ts` wraps Upstash Redis with a `CACHE_PREFIX`-namespaced key helper (`cacheGet`, `cacheAdd`, `cacheKeys`, `cacheDelete`). Handlers follow a consistent cache-aside pattern: build a deterministic key (e.g. `` `daily:pricelist:last:${city}` ``), try `cacheGet`, fall back to a DB query on miss, then `cacheAdd` the result (commonly with a 24h TTL: `{ ex: 60 * 60 * 24 }`). `/service/clear-cache-by-key` allows glob-pattern invalidation.

### LLM / Vector

`src/llm/index.ts` wraps OpenAI chat completions for three report-generation functions (`compareLLMGoods`, `describeLLMGood`, `generateLLMReport`) — prompts are hardcoded to require Markdown-only output translated to Russian. `src/vector/index.ts` wraps Upstash Vector to fetch product metadata by id (used to hydrate product links passed into the LLM routes before prompting). LLM route handlers (`src/llm-routes/*`) cache generated reports the same cache-aside way as other routes.

### Auth model

Two independent, non-overlapping auth schemes coexist (`src/middleware/auth-middleware.ts`):
- `authPublicMiddleware` — frontend-facing routes under `/api`, shared-secret header check, layered on top of Clerk session auth.
- `authServiceMiddleware` — machine-to-machine routes under `/service`, bearer-token check.

Do not conflate the two when adding new routes — pick based on whether the caller is the frontend (with a logged-in Clerk user) or another internal service.

### Observability

`src/otel.ts` (OpenTelemetry SDK + auto-instrumentation, exported via OTLP) and `src/instrument.ts` (Sentry) are imported for side effects only, at the very top of `src/index.ts` / `src/server.ts` respectively — order of these imports relative to other imports matters for instrumentation to attach correctly.

## Code style

Enforced by `eslint.config.ts` and `.prettierrc`: no semicolon-trailing commas, double quotes, 100-char print width, arrow function params unparenthesized when single-arg. Import order is enforced (builtin → external → internal → parent → sibling → index → type) with alphabetization and mandatory blank lines between groups — let `bun run lint:fix` handle this rather than ordering imports by hand.

Path alias `@src/*` maps to `src/*` (see `tsconfig.json`); prefer it over deep relative imports (`../../..`) for cross-directory imports, but sibling/parent-relative imports are used within a route group's own files (e.g. importing a handler's own `helpers/`).
